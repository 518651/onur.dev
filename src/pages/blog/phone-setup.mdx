I've always used lots of apps that I didn't even need. My home screen was a mess and it was really damn hard to find anything.
I decided to go with more minimalist and productive.

Ever since I've become more minimal latelyâ€”even for my phoneâ€”I wanted to further reduce the number of apps I had installed.

Iâ€™m currently down to 80 apps in totalâ€”still working on it tho ðŸ˜…â€”So letâ€™s break down the setup:

<Box
  display="grid"
  gridTemplateColumns={{ _: '1fr', md: 'repeat(2, 1fr)' }}
  gridGap={{ _: '2rem', md: '1.5rem' }}
  my="1rem"
>
  <figure>
    <img src="/static/images/iphone-lock.webp" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '100%' }} />
    <figcaption>Lock Screen</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="/static/images/iphone-home.webp" loading="lazy" style={{ width: '100%' }} />
    <figcaption>Home Screen</figcaption>
  </figure>
</Box>

## Lock Screen

I've discovered [a monochrome wallpaper](https://unsplash.com/photos/Y5BD-H9qGvs) from Unsplash by [Kunj Parekh](https://unsplash.com/@kunjparekh) which is free to download.
The gray and black harmony just looks great and perfectly fits for my minimalist perspective.

## Home Screen

I currently have 29 apps in total (including some system apps), which all fit on a single home screen, but I have grouped a few apps. These are:

### Productivity

- Notion
- Brave
- Medium
- Drive

### Entertainment

- Twitter
- Instagram
- Spotify

### Basics

- Phone
- Messages
- Photos
- Calendar
- Clock
- Settings
- VSCO
- Spark
- Shazam
- LinkedIn
- Tureng (EN-TR translator)
- Gmail
- WhatsApp

### Tools

- Authenticator
- Notes
- Calculator
- Mobile Access
- App Store

### Banking

- Garanti BBVA
- BonuÅŸFlaÅŸ
- N26
- TransferWise

It is worth noting that I do occasionally download other apps if I need to use them only for a short time, but if I no longer need them,
I delete them from my phone. All of the above are apps I use on a regular or semi-regular basis.
