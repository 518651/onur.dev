2020 is probably the best and the worst year I've ever had. I'll try to summarize my notions about it.

---

An unexpected COVID-19 pandemic caught our lives unawares. Some of us lost their family, friends, and familiars, some of
us couldn't accomplish their goals.

I still remember the day that my company at that time sent us to our homes for an unknown date. We were all laughing and
making jokes about it and thinking that people are just exaggerating it. Well, it turns out we all got mistaken. People
started to get sick and die everyday and we never left our homes at least for 3 months. Scary, right? Who would believe
that kind of sh\*t? It's like we are living in a post-apocalyptic world or a movie scene but we all had it. And now, we
learned to living with it.

Lots of things changed. Even though the pandemic was the worst part of my year indeed, the best part was _**setting sail
for a new life**_.

## Career

**I moved to Berlin, Germany!** ðŸ¥³ I've always dreamed living and working in Europe and I was finding myself literally
crying at the airport everytime going back to Turkey. I couldn't even imagine such a thing. And there is fact that I
never lived outside of Turkey, not even by myself in Turkey. So, that's the biggest accomplishment I've had this year.
[You can read my blog post about it in _Turkish_](/bir-yazilimci-olarak-turkiyeden-gitmek-bolum-1-nedenler). I also feel
so lucky to get started with my current company in my new life. Their ambition and values that they care about is
aligning perfectly with my expectations. Hopefully I'll get better everyday and keep contributing more.

## Health

I was around ~97 kgs at my heaviest in the beginning of pandemic (middle of March). Since we were all stuck at our
homes, I thought it will be a great opportunity for me get in shape. Then I started to eat healthy (like extremely) and
do my bodybuilding workouts at least 5 times per week. At the end of 3 months around middle of June, I finally down to
~80 kgs, got much healthier, stronger, and muscled. Since then, I'm still eating healthy (not extremely) and doing my
workouts at least 4 times per week plus abs.

## Website

I rebuilt my website from scratch. My website has transformed over the years from a static HTML site; to Create React
App, to GatsbyJS, and finally to "Next.js + MDX + Chakra UI" combo. I hope you are enjoying it. Feel free to drop your
thoughts or feedbacks via e-mail or twitter. Also, I'm thinking about switching Chakra UI with Tailwind CSS. I always
followed and enjoyed using Tailwind CSS since it came out. There are some advantages and disadvantages in terms of
performance and clean code. I'll evaluate and make a decision about it soon.

## Writing

I published 6 blog posts this year. Not too much but I still see it as a great accomplishment. 3 of them draw a quite
nice attention from you.

- [useFetch: A Custom React Hook](/useFetch-react-hook)
- [Bir YazÄ±lÄ±mcÄ± Olarak TÃ¼rkiyeâ€™den Gitmek (BÃ¶lÃ¼m 1: Nedenler)](/bir-yazilimci-olarak-turkiyeden-gitmek-bolum-1-nedenler)
- [What Iâ€™ve Learned From Working With HTML5 Video Over A Month](/what-i-have-learned-from-working-with-html5-video-over-a-month)

## Skills

I'm always enjoying developing myself with the new and latest technologies. _Next.js_ and _React Native_ are the ones
that I've enjoyed most in this year. For 2021, my biggest wishes are to learn _Figma_ and _German_.

## Mixtapes

I produced 2 mixtapes this year. It's been a while (I mean years) since I created my last mixtape. I couldn't find
enough time and motivation due to my work life unfortunately. But thanks to pandemic (what?), I bought a DJM-450 and at
least had a time and energy to contribute myself with creating 2 delicious mixtapes. I'll definitely produce more
in 2021.

## Resolutions

Well, it's not really my cup of tea describing resolutions but I'll try this year. Here are the things I'm looking
forward to achieve next year:

- Continuing to do my bodybuilding workouts at least 4 times per week
- Learning Figma and German
- Buying a car and exploring Europe â€”if the pandemic would let meâ€”
- Visiting my family and friends in Turkey
- Writing at least 1 blog post per month
- Actualizing some apps on my mind

## 2021?

For the future, I hope to achieve all of my resolutions. If not, I really hope to be as mentally **happy** as I can be.
Because I believe the happiness is beyond everything for me. And it's not easy as it looks, especially when you're far
away from your loved ones. I have a lot of optimism and excitement with 2021. Let's see what's gonna happen.

Thanks for reading.
